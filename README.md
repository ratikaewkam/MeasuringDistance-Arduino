# MeasuringDistance-Arduino
Using Arduino and Ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement

## Components and supplies
* Arduino UNO R3
* Ultrasonic sensor
* I2C LCD Display (Blue Screen)
* jumper wire
* USB 30 cm

## Setup your project
1. Ultrasonic sensor
    * Vcc -> 3.3V
    * Gnd -> Gnd
    * Trig -> 7
    * Echo -> 8
2. I2C LCD Display (Blue Screen)
    * Vcc -> 5V
    * Gnd -> Gnd
    * SDA -> A4
    * SCL -> A5

## Conclusion
After I finished the development of this program. I think this is a simple and good fundamental for advanced robotics. I hope those who visit this repo enjoy developing the program. Thank you.
